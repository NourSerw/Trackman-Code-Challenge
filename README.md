Description of approach taken:

The approach taken has been divided into three parts which are:
	1. Create a function to check if the file given to said script does exist within the directory or not.
	2. If it does exists then parse the JSON file using the json python library down to the "from tag".
	3. Using recursive methods try and find every dependency of tables found using a stack.
